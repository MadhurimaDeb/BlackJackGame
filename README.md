# BlackJackGame

This is a simple blackjack game made for better understanding of javascript. I have used HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT for this project.
rule:
- As you click on START, 2 random cards of value between 2-11 will be drawn and their sum will be calculated
- If it's < 21 then you can draw more curds unless you get =21 (blackjack) or >21(out of game)

I have deployed the game on netlify, link: https://splendorous-paletas-d623db.netlify.app/
